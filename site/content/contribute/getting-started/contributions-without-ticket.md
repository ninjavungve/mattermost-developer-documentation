# Contributions Without Ticket

Contributions for minor corrections and improvements without a ticket are welcome

It is acceptable to submit a PR for a bug or incremental improvement, with less than 20 lines of code change, without a Help Wanted ticket if the change to existing behaviour is minor. All pull requests submitted without a corresponding ticket will first be reviewed by a core team product manager. Some examples of minor corrections and improvements include:

 - [Fix a formatting error in help text](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/5640)
 - [Fix success typo in Makefile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/5809)
 - [Fix broken Cancel button in Edit Webhooks screen](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/5612)
 - [Fix Android app crashing when saving user notification settings](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/pull/364)
 - [Fix recent mentions search not working](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/pull/5878)
 
Larger pull requests, including those that require a change to documentation or user expectations, [require a Help Wanted issue opened by the core team](http://docs.mattermost.com/process/help-wanted.html) so that the change can be tested, documented and supported.

The best way to discuss opening a Help Wanted ticket with the core team is by [starting a conversation in the feature idea forum](https://www.mattermost.org/feature-ideas/) or [opening an issue in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/new). Alternatively, don't hesitate to come chat about it in the [Contributors](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) or [Developers](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers) channels.
