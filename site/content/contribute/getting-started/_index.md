# Getting Started

Welcome to the Mattermost project!

We're very glad you want to join hundreds of community members who have contributed code to Mattermost repositories in GitHub.

Our goal is to make your experience as best as possible. Follow these simple steps to contribute:

1. **Sign up to our Mattermost community site** at [pre-release.mattermost.com](https://pre-release.mattermost.com) and join the [Contributors channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) to ask questions.

2. **Choose which project you want to contribute to**. Click through each to learn more. If you're not sure, try starting with the [server project](/contribute/server/contributing), which offers an easy way to introduce you to the codebase.

* [Server](/contribute/server/) - The highly scalable Mattermost server
* [Webapp](/contribute/webapp/) - The browser webapp built with React
* [Mobile](/contribute/mobile/) - The Android and iOS apps built with React Native
* [Desktop](/contribute/desktop/) - The Electron desktop app that wraps the webapp
* [Redux](/contribute/redux/) - The Redux-based web, storage and logic driver of the web and mobile apps

[See the project repositories page](/contribute/getting-started/respositories/) for a full list of open projects.

3. **Set up your developer machine**. Each project has its own developer setup instructions.

4. **Select a [ticket](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Up+For+Grabs%22)** and comment to let people know you’re working on it. If there’s no ticket for what you want to work on, follow the process [here](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/contribution-guide.html#pull-requests-for-minor-corrections-and-improvements-without-a-ticket-are-welcome).

5. **Start developing**. Each project has its own developer flow for tips on working with the Mattermost codebase. When your changes are ready, run through our [checklist for pull requests](/contribute/contribution-checklist). Note that if it’s your first contribution, there is a standard [CLA](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) to sign.
