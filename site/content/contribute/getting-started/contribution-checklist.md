# Contribution Checklist

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Mattermost! Come [join our "Contributors" community channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets) on our daily build server, where you can discuss questions with community members and the Mattermost core team.

To help with translations, [see the localization process](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/localization.html), follow this checklist for submitting a pull request (PR):

1. You've signed the [Contributor License Agreement](http://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/), so you can be added to the Mattermost [Approved Contributor List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NTCeG-iL_VS9bFqtmHSfwETo5f-8MQ7oMDE5IUYJi_Y/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true).
 - If you've included your mailing address in the signed [Contributor License Agreement](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/), you may receive a [Limited Edition Mattermost Mug](https://forum.mattermost.org/t/limited-edition-mattermost-mugs/143) as a thank you gift after your first pull request is merged.
2. Your ticket is a help wanted GitHub issue for one of the Mattermost project you're contributing to.
 - If not, follow the process [here](/contribute/contributions-without-ticket).
3. Your code follows the [Mattermost Style Guide](http://docs.mattermost.com/developer/style-guide.html).
4. Code thoroughly tested, including appropriate unit tests, [end-to-end tests for webapp](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/webapp-end-to-end-testing.html) and manual testing.
5. If applicable, user interface strings are included in localization files:
 - [../mattermost-server../en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/blob/master/i18n/en.json)
 - [../mattermost-webapp../en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp/blob/master/i18n/en.json)
 - [../mattermost-mobile../en.json](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/assets/base/i18n/en.json)
6. PR is submitted against `master` branch.
7. PR title begins with the JIRA or GitHub Ticket ID (e.g. `MM-394` or `GH-394`) and summary template is filled out.
8. Once submitted, the automated build process must pass for the PR.

That's all! If you have any feedback about this checklist, let us know in the [Contributors channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets).
