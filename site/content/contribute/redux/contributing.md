# Redux Contribution Process

We're very glad you want to join dozens of community members who have contributed code to the Mattermost Redux.

Our goal is to make your experience as best as possible. Follow these simple steps to contribute:

1. **Sign up to our Mattermost community site** at [pre-release.mattermost.com](https://pre-release.mattermost.com) and join the following channels to ask questions.
 - [Contributors](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/tickets)
 - [Developers](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers)
 - [Redux](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/redux)

2. **Set up your environment** by [following these instructions](/contribute/redux/developer-setup).

3. **Select a [Help Wanted ticket](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-redux/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+%5BHelp+Wanted%5D)** and comment to let people know you’re working on it. If there’s no ticket for what you want to work on, start a conversation in the [Redux channel](https://pre-release.mattermost.com/core/channels/redux).

4. **Start developing**. Check out the [Redux developer flow](/contribute/redux/developer-workflow) for tips on working with the codebase. When your changes are ready, run through our [checklist for pull requests](/contribute/contribution-checklist). Note that if it’s your first contribution, there is a standard [CLA](https://www.mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/) to sign.
